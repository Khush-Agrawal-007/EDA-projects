This workspace contains multiple end-to-end EDA and modeling projects. Each project folder now includes a personalized README (created by me) with run instructions and next steps.

Projects covered (organized under `Projects/`)
- Zomato (EDA) â€” `Projects/Zomato/README.md` (notebook `Zomato.ipynb`)
- Customer Shopping Behavior â€” `Projects/Customer_Shopping_Behavior/README.md` (notebook `customer-trends-data-analysis-SQL-Python-PowerBI/Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb`)
- Black Friday EDA â€” `Projects/BlackFriday/README.md` (notebook `Main File/2- BlackFriday EDA And Feature Engineering.ipynb`)
- Flight Prediction â€” `Projects/FlightPrediction/README.md` (notebook `Main File/Flight Prediction/FlightPrediction.ipynb`)
- Zomatodataset preprocessing â€” `Main File/Zomatodataset/1-EDA And Feature Engineering.ipynb` (see `Projects/Zomato`)
- Vendor Performance Analysis â€” `Projects/VendorPerformance/README.md` (repo `vendor-performance-analysis-sql-python-powerbi-test-main`)

Recommended next actions (I can run these for you):
1. Install dependencies and run each notebook end-to-end to capture final outputs.
2. Export notebooks to HTML and/or PDF for portfolio sharing.
3. Replace the contact placeholders above with your live URLs.

Quick export command example: jupyter nbconvert --to html "Zomato.ipynb" --output Zomato_report.html
